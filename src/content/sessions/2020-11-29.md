## Finding Work

We approach the job board and discover that a White Dragon has been spotted in the area. A number of tasks require doing to prepare for a possible attack. Honor, Grenache, and Chet seek info in the Miner's Exchange. They find little, and are told to seek the Townmaster Harbin Wester.

Roman and Ekemon investigate the shrine at the center of town. Roman places 1SP at the shrine to Tymora, Goddess of Luck and Good Fortune. The others speak to the Townmaster, and get directions to the Stone Mill where **Adabra Gwynn** lives.

## Umbridge Hill

We make the 2-hour walk, and as we appreach we hear screaming and commotion from the mill. An iron fence surrounds the mill and the ruins of a house. Behind them are 7 large piles of stone. They are burial cairns to the dead. Who? At the windmill itself is a large winged monster with a spiked tail, trying to knock down the mill. It has three large wounds in its side and is missing some spike.

The manticore was trying to get Adabra's potions, but wasn't asking nicely. We engage and defeat it, Chet dealing the final blow with a brutal decapitation. Adabra thanks us with 2 potions of healing, and tells us the manticore had been in a fight with the dragon, and came down from the Sword Mountains. We emplore her to return to town, but she stubbornly refuses, offering only to provide whatever potions are needed at a fair rate. We return to Harbin and claim our reward.

## Stonehill Inn

At the inn, we buy a round for everyone and ask around about the Dwarven archaeological dig. It's a half-day's journey to the southwest, a big red bush marks the trail. Gnomes are rare around here, and little is known about how to find Gnomengarde.
